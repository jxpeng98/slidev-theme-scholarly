LAYOUT: default (auto-applied when no layout is specified)
PURPOSE: Demonstrates that default layout is automatic

KEY POINT: You don't need to write `layout: default` explicitly.
If you don't specify any layout, Slidev uses "default" automatically.
-->

## This Slide Uses Default Layout

Notice that even without specifying `layout: default`, this slide:

- Uses the default layout automatically
- Shows the footer with author information from the frontmatter
- Displays the conference name in the middle
- Shows page numbers on the right

This demonstrates that **all footer configuration is global** and works across all slides.

title: Theorem Component Demo
subtitle: Mathematical Statements with Auto-numbering

<!--
COMPONENT: <Theorem>
PURPOSE: Display mathematical theorems, definitions, lemmas, etc. with automatic numbering
WHEN TO USE: For academic presentations with formal mathematical statements

FEATURES:
- Automatic numbering (starts from 1, increments globally)
- Multiple types: theorem, lemma, definition, proposition, corollary, example, remark
- Multi-language support (auto-translates based on frontmatter lang setting)
- Optional custom titles
- Optional manual numbering

COMPONENT PROPS:
- type: "theorem" | "lemma" | "definition" | "proposition" | "corollary" | "example" | "remark"
- title: Optional title for the theorem
- number: Optional manual number (e.g., "3.1")
- autoNumber: Set to false to hide number completely

GLOBAL CONFIG (in frontmatter):
- lang: Language code (zh, en, fr, de, es, it, ja, pt, ru)
- theoremNumberFormat: Format string (e.g., '{number}', 'Theorem {number}')

TIP: Numbering resets at start of presentation automatically

## Mathematical Theorems

<Theorem type="theorem" title="Pythagorean Theorem">

For a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\), we have:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="lemma">

All continuous functions on a closed interval are uniformly continuous.

</Theorem>

<!--
THEOREM TYPES EXPLAINED:
- theorem: Major results
- lemma: Helper results used to prove theorems
- definition: Precise definitions of concepts
- proposition: Smaller results
- corollary: Results that follow directly from theorems
- example: Illustrative examples
- remark: Additional notes or observations

All types auto-number separately in presentation order.
-->

## Definitions and Examples

<Theorem type="definition" title="Limit">

Let the function $f$ be defined on an open interval containing point $a$. If for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that when $0 < |x - a| < \delta$, we have $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$, then we say $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="example">

Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$:

- $f(0) = 0$
- $f(1) = 1$
- $f(2) = 4$

</Theorem>

title: More Theorem Types

<!--
MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT:
The component automatically translates labels based on your frontmatter:
- lang: zh ‚Üí "ÂÆöÁêÜ", "ÂºïÁêÜ", "ÂÆö‰πâ" etc.
- lang: en ‚Üí "Theorem", "Lemma", "Definition" etc.
- lang: fr ‚Üí "Th√©or√®me", "Lemme", "D√©finition" etc.
And more languages supported!
-->

## Propositions and Remarks

<Theorem type="proposition">

If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at point $a$, then $f + g$ is also continuous at point $a$.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="corollary">

The sum of a finite number of continuous functions is still a continuous function.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="remark">

Note: This result also holds for the product of continuous functions.

</Theorem>

---
layout: default
title: Manual Numbering Example
subtitle: Override auto-numbering when needed
---

<!--
CUSTOM NUMBERING:
Sometimes you need specific numbering (like "3.1" for chapter 3, theorem 1).
Use the `number` prop to override auto-numbering.

To hide numbering completely, use `:autoNumber="false"` (note the colon for boolean)
-->

## Custom Numbering

<Theorem type="theorem" number="3.1" title="Special Case">

Sometimes we need to use specific numbering, such as 3.1 to represent the first theorem in chapter 3.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="theorem" :autoNumber="false" title="Unnumbered Theorem">

This theorem has no number because `autoNumber={false}` is set.

</Theorem>
