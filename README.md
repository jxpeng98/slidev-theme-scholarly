## What is this?

This is a **theme** (a design template) for [Slidev](https://sli.dev), which is a tool for creating presentation slides using simple text files. Think of it like PowerPoint, but instead of clicking and dragging, you write your content in a simple format called Markdown.

**Why use this theme?**

- ÔøΩ It looks professional and academic (inspired by LaTeX Beamer)
- üéØ Perfect for research presentations, lectures, and conference talks
- ‚ú® Handles complex content like mathematical formulas and theorems
- üöÄ Much faster than PowerPoint once you learn the basics

**No coding experience required!** If you can write an email, you can create presentations with this theme.

---

## Who should use this?

This theme is designed for:

- üë®‚Äçüéì **PhD students** presenting their research
- üë©‚Äçüè´ **Professors** creating lecture slides
- üî¨ **Researchers** preparing conference talks
- üìä **Anyone** who needs professional-looking academic presentations

**You don't need to be a programmer!** The learning curve is gentle, and you'll be creating beautiful slides in minutes.

A layout is like a slide template in PowerPoint. It determines how content is arranged on the slide.

### How to Choose a Layout

At the top of each slide, add:

```yaml
---
layout: layout-name
---
```

If you don't specify a layout, Slidev uses the `default` layout automatically.

## Theorem Components

### What are Theorem Components?

In academic presentations, you often need to present formal statements like theorems, lemmas, or definitions. This theme provides a special component that:

- Automatically numbers your theorems
- Styles them professionally
- Supports multiple languages

### Basic Usage

```markdown
<Theorem type="theorem" title="Pythagorean Theorem">

For a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse $c$:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

</Theorem>
```

**Result:** A nicely formatted box with "Theorem 1 (Pythagorean Theorem)" as the header and your content inside.

### Available Types

Each type has a different color:

| Type | English | Chinese | Color |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| `theorem` | Theorem | ÂÆöÁêÜ | Blue |
| `lemma` | Lemma | ÂºïÁêÜ | Purple |
| `proposition` | Proposition | ÂëΩÈ¢ò | Cyan |
| `corollary` | Corollary | Êé®ËÆ∫ | Green |
| `definition` | Definition | ÂÆö‰πâ | Amber |
| `example` | Example | ‰æã | Pink |
| `remark` | Remark | Ê≥® | Gray |

### Examples

**Simple theorem:**

```markdown
<Theorem type="theorem">

Every bounded sequence has a convergent subsequence.

</Theorem>
```

**Theorem with title:**

```markdown
<Theorem type="definition" title="Continuity">

A function $f$ is continuous at $x = a$ if...

</Theorem>
```

**Manual numbering:**

```markdown
<Theorem type="lemma" number="3.2">

This will be numbered as "Lemma 3.2" instead of auto-numbering.

</Theorem>
```

**No numbering:**

```markdown
<Theorem type="remark" :autoNumber="false">

This remark has no number.

</Theorem>
```

**Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è for academics around the world**

The cover layout is designed for the title slide of your presentation. It supports:

- Centered title and subtitle
- Multiple authors with name, institution, and email
- Beamer-style footer with color gradients
- Customizable footer sections

**Usage with multiple authors (authors array):**

```yaml
---
theme: scholarly
footerMiddle: Conference Name
authors:
  - name: First Author
    institution: University One
    email: first@example.edu
  - name: Second Author
    institution: University Two
    email: second@example.edu
  - name: Third Author
    institution: University Three
    email: third@example.edu
---

# Your Presentation Title

Your subtitle or description
```

**Usage with single author:**

```yaml
---
theme: scholarly
author: Your Name
footerMiddle: Conference or Event Name
---

# Your Presentation Title

Your subtitle or description
```

**Footer Configuration:**

The footer is divided into three sections:

- **Left**: Author information (automatically generated or customizable)
- **Middle**: Custom text (e.g., conference name, event name)
- **Right**: Page numbers (automatically generated)

**Footer configuration options:**

```yaml
---
theme: scholarly
footerLeft: Custom Author Text    # Optional: Override author display
footerMiddle: Conference Name      # Optional: Middle section text
authors:
  - name: First Author
    institution: University One
  - name: Second Author
    institution: University Two
---
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Global Configuration**: All frontmatter fields (authors, footerLeft, footerMiddle, etc.) defined at the beginning of your slides.md file are available globally across all slides
- **Default Layout**: If no layout is specified for a slide, it will use the `default` layout automatically
- Use either `author` (for single author) or `authors` array (for multiple authors)
- Do not use both `author` and `authors` at the same time
- When using `authors` array, each author can have `name`, `institution`, and `email` fields
- The author information will be displayed in the center of the cover slide
- **Footer configuration is global**: Footer settings (footerLeft, footerMiddle, authors) defined in the frontmatter at the top of your presentation will be used on all slides
- **Footer left section display rules:**
  - 1 author: Shows the author's name
  - 2 authors: Shows "Author1 & Author2"
  - 3 authors: Shows "Author1, Author2, Author3"
  - 4+ authors: Shows "First Author et al."
- You can override the footer left section by setting `footerLeft` in frontmatter
- `conference` field is deprecated, use `footerMiddle` instead (backward compatible)

**Example of a complete presentation:**

```markdown
---
theme: academic
footerMiddle: "My Conference 2025"
authors:
  - name: First Author
    institution: University One
    email: first@example.edu
  - name: Second Author
    institution: University Two
    email: second@example.edu
---

# My Presentation Title

Subtitle text

---

# Second Slide

This slide will automatically use the default layout and show the footer with author information.

---
layout: intro
---

# Section Introduction

All layouts (cover, default, intro) will show the same footer configured at the top.
```

### Other Layouts

All layouts in this theme include the Beamer-style footer with author and conference information.

- **`default`** - Default slide layout with content and footer
- **`intro`** - Introduction slide layout with larger text
- **`center`** - Centered content layout
- **`section`** - Section divider with large title
- **`quote`** - Quote layout with styled blockquote
- **`fact`** - Single fact or number with large text
- **`statement`** - Statement layout with medium-large text
- **`image-left`** - Two-column layout with image on the left
- **`image-right`** - Two-column layout with image on the right
- **`two-cols`** - Two-column layout for general content

**Usage example:**

```markdown
---
layout: section
---

# Section Title

---
layout: image-right
image: https://example.com/image.jpg
---

# Content Title

Content goes here

---
layout: quote
---

> "This is a quote"

---
layout: two-cols
---

# Left Column

Content for the left side

::right::

# Right Column

Content for the right side
```

**Important**: All layouts automatically include the footer. You don't need to add it manually.

### Creating Custom Layouts

If you need to create a custom layout in your presentation, make sure to include the `<AcademicFooter />` component to maintain consistency:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="slidev-layout my-custom-layout">
    <!-- Your custom content -->
    <slot />
    
    <!-- Import the footer component -->
    <AcademicFooter />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import ScholarlyFooter from '@slidev-theme-scholarly/components/ScholarlyFooter.vue'
</script>
```

This ensures that all slides, regardless of layout, display the unified footer with author and conference information.

## Components

This theme provides the following components:

### Theorem Component

The `Theorem` component allows you to insert mathematical theorems, lemmas, propositions, and other formal statements in your slides with automatic numbering and multi-language support.

**Props:**

- `type`: The type of statement - `'theorem'` | `'lemma'` | `'proposition'` | `'corollary'` | `'definition'` | `'example'` | `'remark'` (default: `'theorem'`)
- `number`: Optional manual number (string or number). If provided, auto-numbering is disabled for this theorem.
- `title`: Optional title for the theorem
- `autoNumber`: Enable/disable auto-numbering (default: `true`)

**Multi-language Support:**

Set the `lang` field in your frontmatter to use different languages:

```yaml
---
theme: academic
lang: zh  # Chinese (‰∏≠Êñá) - default
# OR
lang: en  # English
---
```

**Customize Numbering Format:**

You can customize how theorem numbers are displayed using the `theoremNumberFormat` field:

```yaml
---
theme: academic
lang: en
theoremNumberFormat: '{number}'  # Default: just the number (e.g., "1", "2", "3")
# OR
theoremNumberFormat: '({number})'  # Parentheses (e.g., "(1)", "(2)", "(3)")
# OR
theoremNumberFormat: '[{number}]'  # Brackets (e.g., "[1]", "[2]", "[3]")
# OR
theoremNumberFormat: '{number}.'  # With period (e.g., "1.", "2.", "3.")
---
```

The `{number}` placeholder will be replaced with the actual theorem number.

**Auto-numbering:**

By default, theorems are automatically numbered. Each type (theorem, lemma, etc.) has its own counter:

```markdown
---
theme: academic
lang: en
---

# Mathematical Results

<Theorem type="theorem" title="Pythagorean Theorem">

For a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse $c$:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

</Theorem>
<!-- Displays: "Theorem 1 (Pythagorean Theorem)" -->

<Theorem type="theorem">

Another theorem here.

</Theorem>
<!-- Displays: "Theorem 2" -->

<Theorem type="lemma">

A useful lemma.

</Theorem>
<!-- Displays: "Lemma 1" -->
```

**Manual numbering:**

You can override auto-numbering by providing the `number` prop:

```markdown
<Theorem type="theorem" number="3.1" title="Special Case">

Content here.

</Theorem>
<!-- Displays: "Theorem 3.1 (Special Case)" -->
```

**Disable numbering:**

```markdown
<Theorem type="remark" :autoNumber="false">

This remark has no number.

</Theorem>
<!-- Displays: "Remark" (without number) -->
```

**Language Examples:**

Chinese (zh):

```markdown
<Theorem type="theorem" title="ÂãæËÇ°ÂÆöÁêÜ">
ÂÜÖÂÆπ...
</Theorem>
<!-- Displays: "ÂÆöÁêÜ 1ÔºàÂãæËÇ°ÂÆöÁêÜÔºâ" -->
```

English (en):

```markdown
<Theorem type="theorem" title="Pythagorean Theorem">
Content...
</Theorem>
<!-- Displays: "Theorem 1 (Pythagorean Theorem)" -->

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="lemma" number="2.1">

Every continuous function on a closed interval is uniformly continuous.

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="definition" title="Limit">

Let $f$ be a function defined on some open interval containing $a$. We say:

$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$$

if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that...

</Theorem>

<Theorem type="example">

Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$. Then:
- $f(0) = 0$
- $f(1) = 1$
- $f(2) = 4$

</Theorem>
```

**Available types and their colors:**

- `theorem` - Blue (ÂÆöÁêÜ)
- `lemma` - Purple (ÂºïÁêÜ)
- `proposition` - Cyan (ÂëΩÈ¢ò)
- `corollary` - Green (Êé®ËÆ∫)
- `definition` - Amber (ÂÆö‰πâ)
- `example` - Pink (‰æã)
- `remark` - Gray (Ê≥®)

Each type has a distinct color scheme to help differentiate them visually in your presentation.
